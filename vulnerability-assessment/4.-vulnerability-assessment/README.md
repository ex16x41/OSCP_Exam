# Vulnerability Assessment

* To find vulnerabilities using automated tools.
* Before running a vulnerability assessment you should know how much traffic will be pumped in the network.
* You must also consider that, due to vulnerability scanning network devices may go down.

## Using searchsploit

* say you are searching for “Apache 2.4.7” vulnerabilities
  * Start by searching for the exact versions and then slowly making the search more general.
  * `searchsploit Apache 2.4.7 | grep -v ‘/dos/`
  * `searchsploit Apache 2.4 | grep -v '/dos/' | wc -l`
  * `searchsploit -t --colour Apache 2.4` looks for only exploit titles and does not check the exploit path
    * `-t` checks only exploit title.
    * `--colour` tells to not to add colour so that we could use grep/
    * `wc -l` : How many lines does search have.
    * `tail` : on demand list of contents.
    * else display all contents.
  * `searchsploit Apache 2 | grep -v ‘/dos/’`
  * `searchsploit Apache 2.x | grep -v ‘/dos/’`
* Use of regular expressions in searching, we need to disable color for this.s
* `searchsploit Apache 2 | grep -vi ‘./php[^$]’`
  * `[^/w]` match one character which is not a alphanumeric character.  → to remove lines with “.php'” “.php?” “.php/” etc...  → To only includes “.php” and “.php$”
* If nothing found the best way to search for vulnerability is google search with dork site:exploit-db.com
