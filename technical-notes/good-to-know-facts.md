# Good To know facts

## 1. ASCII vs Utf-8

* Utf-8 could represent the complete unicode characters.
* ASCII is a subset of UTF-8 encoding.
  * They are both are byte encoding
* I find no good reason to use UTF-8 untill, you want to print characters outside of ASCII. Below is chart for all ASCII character.
* We use UTF-8 when we want to print character in other languages, like chinese or spanish character.
