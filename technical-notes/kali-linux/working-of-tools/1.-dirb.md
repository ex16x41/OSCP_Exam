# 1. dirb

## Default search : 

![basic dirb search](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29.png)

* Above is a simple dirb search.
* I am just finding what all other files and directories are there.
* Wordlist "`../dirb/wordlists/common.txt`"
  * If we look at this wordlist, it is a simple wordlist, with just words with no extensions.

![content of &quot;common.txt&quot; file](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2855%29.png)

* So dirb is non intelligent tool, it just appends the words in "common.txt" line by line on our input target "http://192.168.137.162"
  * Example : `http://192.168.137.162/zoeken`
* Then it just observes the http error code. Generally "204,301,302,307,200,403, etc" is what it shows output.
  * We could always tweak it using `-f` and `-N` parameters.
* Limitation of this search,
  * Given not intelligent search, you need to manually tell dirb of extension like ".php" in PHP supported websites, or ".asp" in ASP supported websites.
  * The "common.txt" wordlist has a limited and general scope. Like if you want to search for .cgi file, the file names are different that that found in "common.txt" wordlists. Good thing we always have such lists readily available on internet.

## Specialized Search :

* While doing most of the CTF and Boot2root boxes, you will definitely come across sites that supports PHP.
* Default dirb search will not show all the pages, as it is not intelligent enough to get the website supports webpages. 
* To solve this we need to manually tell it to search for .php extensions.

![PHP dirb search](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2848%29.png)

* What this will do is append all the "common.txt" words with ".php" at the end of this list. 
* Now the resultant list is an intelligent list to work on and check the responses.
