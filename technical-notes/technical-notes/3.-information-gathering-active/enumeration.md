# 3.1 Enumeration

It is a very general term to me, as listing could be of anything. To me enumeration is most important part of pentesting. Before beginning an attack, we do not know anything about our victim. So we use information gathering to gather more info on our victim. To gather information, we look first for passive information present of the victim. After this we move to active information gathering.

To me the term enumeration is, to actively gathering information. This mean to find these 3 things:

1. system
2. services
3. vulnerabilities

The use of enumeration is to find all the possible opening on the victim, which we could exploit. Then out of the list of opening we use the most safest option, so that we are not detected and make as less noise as possible.

> Improper enumeration could lead to failed pentesting. Which it very harmful because other malicious attackers could exploit the unexplored enumeration.
