# 8.1 Understanding Open, Closed and Filtered Ports

For Example you are sending a packet to establish communication on a given port. You are the source of the packet. When the packet travels to the destination, a firewall comes between source and the destination to check if that packet is allowed to enter or not. If it is allowed, then the packet is sent to the destination. On receiving the packet by the destination, if the request is correct and it can be satisfied, a positive response is sent to the source. Else if is not correct or cannot be satisfied, a negative response is sent. Best practices of firewall is that, it must stop all the requests that are not correct and not be satisfied at the firewall level itself, it should not allow these requests to go in.

## Open Port

* The firewall has allowed the packet.
* The server has responded to the packet, with a positive response.
* The service on the requested port is running.

## Closed Port

* The firewall has allowed the packet
* The server has responded to the packet, with a negative response.
* The service on the requested port is not running.

## Filtered Port

* The firewall has blocked the packet, and has not responded back to the source.
* The server is not aware of the packet.
* The source is unaware of either any service on the port is running or not.
