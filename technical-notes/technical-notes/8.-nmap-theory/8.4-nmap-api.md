# 8.4 Nmap API

## Network I/O API

* NSE provides an interface to **Nsock, the Nmap socket library**.
* they never block on I/O operations, allowing many scripts to be run in parallel.
* There are two network I/O API
  * Connect-style network I/O
  * Raw packet network I/O

### Connect-style network I/O

* Everything up to the Transport layer \(which is either TCP, UDP or SSL\) is handled by the library.

### Raw packet network I/O

* Raw packet reception is handled through a Libpcap wrapper inside the Nsock library. 
* The steps are to open a capture device, register listeners with the device, and then process packets as they are received.
* Example 
  * `ipidseq` script
  * `sniffer-detect` script
