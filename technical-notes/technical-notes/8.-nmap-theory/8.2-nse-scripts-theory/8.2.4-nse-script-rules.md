# 8.2.4 NSE Script Rules

Nmap uses the script rules to determine whether a script should be run against a target. A rule is a Lua function that returns either `true` or `false`. The script `action` function is only performed if the rule evaluates to `true`.

Note : `host` = Host Table

A script must contain one or more of the following functions that determine when the script will be run:

* `prerule()` 
  * runs once before host discovery. 
  * No arguments needed.
  * if the script is doing host discovery or any other network operation then the `prerule` should be used.
* `hostrule(host)`
  * Runs for each batch of hosts scanned. 
  * Host table argument needed.
* `portrule(host, port)` 
  * Runs for each batch of hosts scanned. 
  * Host table and Port table argument  needed.
  * Port rules generally test factors such as the port number, port state, or listening service name in deciding whether to run against a port.
* `postrule()` 
  * `postrule` is reserved for reporting of data and statistics that were gathered during the scan.
  * No arguments
  * Runs after all the scanning phases are completed.

## Host Table

This table is passed as a parameter to the rule and action functions.

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| host.os | host.ip |
| host.name | host.targetname |
| host.reason | host.reason\_ttl |
| host.mac\_addr | host.mac\_addr\_next\_hop |
| host.mac\_addr\_src | host.interface |
| host.interface\_mtu | host.directly\_connected |
| host.bin\_ip | host.bin\_ip\_src |
| host.times | host.traceroute |
| host.os\_fp |  |

## Port Table

The port table is passed to an NSE service script only those with a portrule.

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| port.number | port.protocol |
| port.service | port.reason |
| port.reason\_ttl | port.version |
| port.state |  |
