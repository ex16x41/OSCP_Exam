NBT : netbios over tcp

The SMB NetBIOS34 service listens on TCP ports 139 and 445, as well as several UDP ports.

### NetBIOS provides three distinct services:

1. Name service \(NetBIOS-NS\) for name registration and resolution via port **137**.
2. Datagram distribution service \(NetBIOS-DGM\) for connection less communication via port **138**.
3. Session service \(NetBIOS-SSN\) for connection-oriented communication via port **139**. ****
