# TTY session

Type of shell.

* A shell is command line interpreter.
* A terminal is a text input/output environment.
* A console is a physical terminal
* "TeleTYpe" \(aka TTY\) - can be found in "/dev/tty\*". They are devices that acts like a "teletype" \(such as a terminal\).
* "Pseudo-TeletYpe" \(aka PTY\) - These are devices that acts like a terminal to the process reading/writing there, but managed by something else. **So we can use PTY to fake TTY**.
