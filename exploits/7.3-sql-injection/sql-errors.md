# SQL Errors

### "null" Response

After executing a SQL query if the response is null, then,

* First verify if you have entered the right SQL query.
  * Check which database flavor you are using, MS-SQL, MySQL, Oracle.
  * This is very important as syntax across all these flavors are different. See the screenshot below.
* If the query is good, then the current user does not have privileges to execute the query.

![&quot;LIMIT 1&quot; is for MySQL and &quot;TOP 1&quot; is for MS-SQL](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28108%29.png)

* The SQL is coded to only print one line, but your **SQL query has multi-line response.**
  * For MS-SQL use, `STRING_AGG(name, ',')`   OR   `TOP 1 name` see the screenshots below.
