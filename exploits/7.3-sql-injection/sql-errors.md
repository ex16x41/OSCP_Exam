# SQL Errors

### "null" Response

* After executing a SQL query if the response is null, then,
  * First verify if you have entered the right SQL query.
    * Check which database flavor you are using, MS-SQL, MySQL, Oracle.
    * This is very important as syntax across all these flavors are different. See the screenshot below.
  * If the query is good, then the current user does not have privileges to execute the query.
