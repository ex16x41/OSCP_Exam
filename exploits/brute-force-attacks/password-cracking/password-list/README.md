# 3.1 Methodology

### Tools

* Hashcat
  * Hashcat have rules that when applied to a list of passwords, created a list of scrambled fuzzing passwords. Rules can be like toggle uppercase and lowercases.
  * hashcat --force --stdout pwlist.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
  * Note : The list with multiple chained hashcat rules could have duplicates.
* Crunch
* Manually
* Seclists

## Approach 1

### Part 1

1. Create a list of all months
2. Add english seasons
3. Permute this list with year
   1. `for i in $(cat pass.txt); do echo $i; echo ${i}2019; echo ${i}2020; done`

### Part 2

1. Add Part 1 list
2. Add list of 500 most common passwords "SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/500-worst-passwords.txt"
3. And passwords from previous CTF boxes

Combining part 1 and part 2 we get a list 

### Part 3

* Add Part 2 list
* %username%
* %domain name%
* %hostname%
* %subdomains%
* CeWL 

## Approach 2 - Web Login Pages
