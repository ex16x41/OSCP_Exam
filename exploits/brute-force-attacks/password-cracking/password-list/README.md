# 3.1 Methodology

### Tools

* Hashcat
  * Hashcat have rules that when applied to a list of passwords, created a list of scrambled fuzzing passwords. Rules can be like toggle uppercase and lowercases.
  * hashcat --force --stdout pwlist.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
  * Note : The list with multiple chained hashcat rules could have duplicates.
* Crunch
* Manually
* Seclists

## Approach 1

### Part 1

1. Create a list of all months
2. Add english seasons
3. Permute this list with year
   1. `for i in $(cat pass.txt); do echo $i; echo ${i}2019; echo ${i}2020; done`

### Part 2

1. Add list of 500 most common passwords "SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/500-worst-passwords.txt"
2. And passwords from previous CTF boxes

**Combining part 1 and part 2 we get a list** [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nEcr0tik/htb/master/mine-scripts/passwords/2pass.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nEcr0tik/htb/master/mine-scripts/passwords/2pass.txt)

### Part 3

* Create a list "3part.txt"
  * %all enumerated username%
  * %domain name%
  * %hostname%
  * %subdomains%
* Add the below words
  * 2019, 2020, 01, 123, 00, !, @
  * `for i in $(cat 3part.txt); do echo $i; echo ${i}2019; echo ${i}2020; ${i}@123; ${i}!; ${i}00; ${i}01; ${i}123; 2019@${i}; 2020@${i}; ${i}@2019; ${i}@2020 done > 3pass.txt`
* Now apply hashcat rule of appending all combinations of these words

### Part 4
