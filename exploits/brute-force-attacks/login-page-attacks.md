# 1. Login Page Attacks

### Step 1 : Find source code of the login web page

* The login web page information could be present in github.
* For name of application / script could be present :
  * **In URL**, eaxmple "wp-admin" means wordpress login page.
  * In Source code, example, a designer could have saved the github link of the page.
* Give efforts to find source code because it makes our job easy, it is always that designer publish their code in github.
* Uses of source code
  * This is another method of enumerating more functionalities of the login page. Like register page, forgot password page, new user page, etc. It gives us more attack points.
  * helps us to understand the functionality and also what kind of input validation is used.
  * Using this we could launch a SQLi attack.

### Step 2 : Username enumeration

* We need to enumerate users, this can be done using,
  * Forgot password page
  * User login page where error is "The username is valid and password is invalid"
  * Some webpage may have a list of all employees working.
* We can make use of "**Seclists**" to get list of common usernames.
* We do not need **potential usernames**, we first need **confirmed usernames**.
* If **confirmed usernames** are not there, then we can use **potential usernames**.

### Step 3 : Password list

* First check if login page has a lockout policy. If not then we can perform brute force attack.
* We cannot create a golden list which will definitely crack everything.
* The password generation could be categorized as below.
* Basic
  * **Using cewl generate list of keywords.**
  * +
  * **Add all enumerated users first name**
  * +
  * **Add all enumerated users last name**
  * +
  * \(Advanced 1\) Add months and years and apply hashcat rule to append and prepend all combinations
  * +
  * \(Advanced\) Use a hashcat rule on this list to get more random passwords. Here do not do \(Advanced 1\)
* Common cracking lists
  * rockyou.txt
  * and other password lists from seclists.
