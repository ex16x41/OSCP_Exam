# Hydra

* We could crack a wide range of protocol authentication schemes using hydra.
* We should be very careful with the hydra, as mistake in one of the parameter will not execute hydra.
* 
## Username enumeration

![&quot;-e n&quot; option in hydra](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2840%29.png)

## Password cracking

* "/dvwa/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:F=incorrect:H=Cookie: PHPSESSID=07b7ebb2faea96f8471ecdb759e68108; security=low"

## Example : HTTP Basic authorization with base64

* -C option in hydra accepts a list of : seperate username:password list. It will automatically url encode to base64.
* You can validate this by setting burp suite proxy.

## Troubleshooting 1

To resolve this correct your "grep condition" which is your last parameter of hydra. To correct use the error from the webpage for the desired differentiation.

The correct condition seems to be "ERROR" or "incorrect"
