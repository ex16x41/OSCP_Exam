# File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

* These are seen in web applications which run using PHP and are poorly coded. It depends on PHP version and webserver configurations in php.ini such as:
  * Register global 
  * allow URL option
* To include either remote or local .php files into the URL wrapper and executing the scripts.

## 7.2.1 File Traversal vulnerability

* Step 0 : "http://192.168.1.1/site.php?page=firstpage". This means site is vulnerable to local file inclusion.
* Step 1 : http://192.168.1.1/site.php?page=..%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2F.%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%00
* Step 2 : If we are able to perform this file traversal, that means we could perform local file inclusion.
* Step 3: Now we could proceed for remote file inclusion.

## 7.2.2 Remote File Inclusion

* Requirements
  * enable "allow\_url\_fopen"
  * enable "allow\_url\_include"
* Running .php from from client/attacker system in to the PHP server. 
* These are more harmful exploits. 

## 7.2.3 LFI enable and RFI disabled - Approach 1

* Given that the requirements are not met for RFI.
* We First somehow send malicious code to the victim machine. Here we have used the [log transfer method](../../notes/4.-file-transfer/#list-of-different-ways-for-transferring-a-file) in apache web server.
* We use a common method for ease of the RFI attack. As below:
  * We introduce a new variable in URL \("cmd"\). We fill the variable with our desired command that need to be executed.
  * Using RFI we tell the server to user this URL parameter and execute the text in "cmd" variable.
    * `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>`

## 7.2.4 LFI enabled and RFI disabled - Approach 2

* We could use LFI + SQL injection here.

## 7.2.3 Local File Inclusion

* No such requirements, these type of attacks occurs due to bad desgin on PHP website.
* Running .php file already present in the victim PHP server.

### 7.2.3.1 PHP LFI special case

* PHP wrappers and filter options to print contents of files present in webserver.
* /?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index
* This approach is used in scenarios like this:

> I came across a website where the site was vulnerable to LFI \(local file inclusion\) however the inclusion was done using a [require\_once](http://php.net/manual/en/function.require-once.php) and the script appended a .php extension to the end of the file; furthermore it was not vulnerable to null byte injection which meant that if I did include a file that:
>
> 1. The file would have to be valid PHP syntax
> 2. I would not be able to see anything contained between &lt;? ?&gt; tags
> 3. Anything I could include would be executed.
> 4. The file would have to end in the PHP extension
