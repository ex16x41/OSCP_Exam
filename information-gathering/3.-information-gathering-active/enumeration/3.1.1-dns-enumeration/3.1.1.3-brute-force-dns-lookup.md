# 3.1.1.3 Brute Force DNS lookup

## Introduction to Brute Force

* Brute forcing doesn't always mean passwords attacks. Its the process of guessing, by trying certain combinations \(either pre-defined from a dictionary/wordlist or trying every possible value, increasing its value each time\).

### Example

1. URL brute force =&gt; Dirb or URL enumeration
2. Online web password brute force =&gt; Hydra or Medusa or Ncrack

## Forward Lookup brute force

Generate a list or get a list of common hostnames for the domain like "www", "ftp", "mail", "router", etc.

Later we could code a simple for loop to do the host lookup

## Reverse Lookup Brute force

To do this we need some information of the environment, like the IP ranges to search. Generally, first "Forward lookup Brute force" is done and some useful information is obtained then we do "Reverse lookup Brute force". Here we use an IP range and give it input to host command to find the respective hostnames for the given domain name.
