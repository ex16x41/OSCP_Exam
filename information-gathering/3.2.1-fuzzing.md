# 4. Fuzzing

Fuzzing involves sending malformed data into application input and watching for unexpected crashes.

Fuzzing is like an art to me. It is not of everybody's taste. To me this is the most difficult part. It involves two things.

1. Software/Web app testing.
2. You should be aware of how technology works at assembly level.

You need experience in both software testing and pentesting to fuzz.

## Step 1\) Identifying various input points

* We need to list all the points of input.
* d

## Step 2\) Analyze Accepted data

### 2.1 Acceptable special characters

### 2.2 Acceptable Encoding schemes

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwR746pfTEc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwR746pfTEc) \(35:00 - 38:00\)
* Use different encoding schemes and check which schemes are accepted and which are rejected.
  * ASCII : "a"
  * Unicode : "\u27" or "\u0027"

![HTTP code 200 : encoding acceptable](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28103%29.png)

## Step 3\) We try to send various malformed data.

* our main intention of sending this malformed data, is that we get unexpected behavior or the application crashed \(which is also an unexpected behavior\).
* like carefully designed input such that the application break.
* like sending special symbols
* like sending a large data as input
* like sending random values
